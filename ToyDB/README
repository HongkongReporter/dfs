KVStore 

- This module requires the golang installation

- To use the server, say for eventual consistency: cd into the directory dkvs/ecdkvs and run:
go run . PORT
Where PORT is the number for the port the server listens to

Ecdkvs: eventual consistency
Lcdkvs: linearizable consistency
Scdkvs: sequential consistency

- To test, cd into the directory client and type:
go run . PORT
PORT is the PORT number where the server will listen
This opens the client process
e.g. 
For server: go run . 1234
For client: go run . 127.0.0.1:1234

The original code has 5 servers spawn, in kvserver.go, line 22
