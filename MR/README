README 

First, make sure you have go 1.17.7 installed: https://go.dev/, or check by go version.

For Applications utilizing the MR library, we load the applications as plugins, see https://pkg.go.dev/plugin. Note that till now Golang plugin only supports Linux, MacOS and FreeBSD. Go plugin supports the independent publication of new features and applications.
To build the plugin, for instance, we wish to run word count applications by MR library, we first cd into the directory src/main and run
>> go build -race -buildmode=plugin ../mrapps/wc.go
This will give you a fresh built wc.so file, and we can use this wc.so file to build the MR package.

First, we run the master node…
>> go run -race mrcoordinator.go pg-*.txt
Then we can spawn the worker process… 
>> go run -race mrworker.go wc.so pg*.txt

To test, run in src/main$: bash test.sh This generates all the tests 

Check Report's Section 1 and 4 for more details.
